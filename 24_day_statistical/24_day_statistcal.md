<!-- Day 24: 30 Days of python programming -->

# Exercises - Day 24 
- For exercises, repated all the examples

# Notes - Statistical Analysis
- Statistics and Data

## Statistics Module
- The Python statistics module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numerical data
- The module is not intended to be a competitor to third-party libraries such as NumPy, SciPy or proprietary full-featured statistics packages like Minitab, SAS and Matlab
- The module is aimed at the level of graphing and scientific calculators

## NumPy
- NumPy is the core library for scientific ciomputing in Python
- It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with arrays
- A good tool for this is Jupyter Notebook
    - To access Jupyter Notebook, install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)


```
# install NumPy
pip install numpy

# Import NumPy
  import numpy as np

# How to check the version of the numpy package
print('numpy:', np.__version__)

# Checking the available methods
print(dir(np))
```
