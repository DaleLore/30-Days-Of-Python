# Notes - File Handling
- File handling is an import part of programming which allows us to create, read, update, and delete files
- An important built-in function to handle data is `open()`

    - Opening Files for Reading
        - Syntax: open('filename', mode)
        - Mode options
            - `r` - Read - default value - this opens a file for reading, it returns an error if the file does not exist
            - `a` - Append - opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
            - `w` - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
            - `x` - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
            - `t` - Text - Default value - text mode
            - `b` - Binary - binary mode (e.g. images)
    
    - Opening Files for Writing and Updating
        - The default mode of open is reading so adding `r` isn't necessary a lot of the times
