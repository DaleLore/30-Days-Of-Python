<!-- Day 3: 30 Days of python programming -->

# Exercises - Day 3
- Declare variables
- Write user prompts
- Do calculations 

# Notes
- A boolean data type represents one of two values: True or False

## Operators
- Assignment Operators
    - Assignment operators are the same in other languages; they are used to assign values to variables

- Arithmetic Operators
    - Addition(+): a + b
    - Subtraction(-): a - b
    - Multiplication(*): a * b
    - Division(/): a / b
    - Modulus(%): a % b
    - Floor division(//): a // b
    - Exponentiation(**): a ** b

- Comparison Operators
    - Equal (==): a == b
    - Not equal (!=): a != b
    - Greater than (>): a > b
    - Less than (<): a < b
    - Greater than or equal to (>=): a >= b
    - Less than or equal to (>=): a <= b

- More ways to compare
    - is: Returns true if both variables are the same object(a is b)
    - is not: Returns true if both variables are not the same object(a is not b)
    - in: Returns True if the queried list contains a certain item(a in b)
    - not in: Returns True if the queried list doesn't have a certain item(a in b)

- Logical Operators
    - and: returns True if both statements are true (a < 5 and a < 10)
    - or: returns True if one of the statements is true (a < 5 or b < 4)
    - not: reverse the result, returns False if the result is true (not(a < 5 and a < 10))
