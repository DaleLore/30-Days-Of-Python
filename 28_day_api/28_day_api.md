# Exercises - Day 28 


# Notes - Application Programming Interface (API)
- This section will cover Web APIs
- Web APIs are defined interfaces through which interactions happen between an enterprise and applications that use its assets, which also is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to specify the functional provider and expose the service path or URL for its API users

- In the context of web development, an API is defined as a set of specifications, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, usually in an XML or a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format

- Web API has been moving away from Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based web services and service-oriented architecture (SOA) towards more direct representatationals state transfer (REST) style web resources

- Social media services, web APIs have allowed web communities to share content and data between communities and different platforms

- Using API, content that is created in one place dynamically can be posted and updated to multiple locations on the web

- Many applications provide API end points
    - Some examples of API such as the [countries API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) and [cat's breed API](https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds)
    - HTTP request methods to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE data
