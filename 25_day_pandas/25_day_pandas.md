# Exercises - Day 25 


# Notes - Pandas
- Panadas is an open-source, high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and ata analysis tools for the Python programming language
- Panadas adds data structures and tools designed to work with table-like data which is <i>Series</i> and <i>Data Frames</i>
- Pandas provides tools for data manipulation:
    - reshaping
    - merging
    - sorting
