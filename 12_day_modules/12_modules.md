<!-- Day 12: 30 Days of python programming -->

# Exercises - Day 12
## Exercise Level 1
1. Write a function which generates a six digit/character random_user_id

2. Modify the previous task. Declare a function named user_id_gen_by_user. It doesnâ€™t take any parameters but it takes two inputs using input(). One of the inputs is the number of characters and the second input is the number of IDs which are supposed to be generated.

3. Write a function named rgb_color_gen. It will generate rgb colors (3 values ranging from 0 to 255 each).

## Exercise Level 2
1. Write a function list_of_hexa_colors which returns any number of hexadecimal colors in an array (six hexadecimal numbers written after #. Hexadecimal numeral system is made out of 16 symbols, 0-9 and first 6 letters of the alphabet, a-f. Check the task 6 for output examples).

2. Write a function list_of_rgb_colors which returns any number of RGB colors in an array.

3. Write a function generate_colors which can generate any number of hexa or rgb colors.

## Exercise Level 3
1. Call your function shuffle_list, it takes a list as a parameter and it returns a shuffled list

2. Write a function which returns an array of seven random numbers in a range of 0-9. All the numbers must be unique.

# Notes - Modules
- A module is a file containing a set of codes or a set of functions which can be imported and used in other Python programs
- A module can be as simple as a file with a single variable or function, or as complex as a large code base.
- Modules help organize and reuse code, making it more manageable and maintainable.

## What to do with Modules
- Creating a module follows the same steps as creating any Python script. The first step is simply saving it as a .py file.

- You can import the entire file with the keyword, <i>import</i>
```
import file_name
```

- You can import a specific function(s) with <i>import</i> as well
```
from file_name import function_1, function_2, funtion_3
```

- You may need to rename a function when importing it into a different context
```
from file_name import function_1 as method_1, function_2 as method_1, funtion_3 as method_1
```

## Import Built-In Modules
- Python comes with a large number of built-in modules, and the exact number can vary depending on the version and the specific Python distribution you're using, but you can see a general list on [w3schools Module Index for Python](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html) or in a filem write:
```
import sys
print(sys.builtin_module_names)
```

- The standard library includes hundreds of modules covering a wide range of functionalities, from file handling to mathematical operations and network communication
    - Example: datetime: Date and time manipulation.
    - Example: json: JSON data parsing and generation.
    - Example: collections: High-performance container datatypes.

### OS: Operating system interfaces
- This provides functions for creating, changing current working direcotry and removing a directory, fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory
```
# import the module
import os
# Creating a directory
os.mkdir('directory_name')
# Changing the current directory
os.chdir('path')
# Getting current working directory
os.getcwd()
# Removing directory
os.rmdir()
```

### SYS: System-specific parameters and functions
- This provides functions and variables used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment.
- Function sys.argc returns a list of command line arguments passed to a Python script
- The item at index 0 in this list is always the name of the script, at index 1 is the argument passed from the command line
```
# import the module
import os
# Creating a directory
os.mkdir('directory_name')
# Changing the current directory
os.chdir('path')
# Getting current working directory
os.getcwd()
# Removing directory
os.rmdir()

# In terminal
python script.py Python coder 30DaysOfPython
```

### Statistics
- This module provides functions for mathematical statistics of numeric data
- Some popular statistical functions are: mean, median, mode, stdev

### math: Mathematical functions
- This module contains many mathematical operations and constants
- This module can also help us to perform mathematical calculations. 
    - To check what functions the module has got, we can use help(math), or dir(math)

### String
- A string module provides various constants, utility functions, and classes to work with strings more efficiently. It includes pre-defined string constants like all letters or digits, and also provides templates for advanced string formatting.
```
import string
print(string.ascii_letters) # abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
print(string.digits)        # 0123456789
print(string.punctuation)   # !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
```

### Random: Random number generation.
- This module provides random numbers between 0 and 0.9999+
```
from random import random, randint
print(random())   # it doesn't take any arguments; it returns a value between 0 and 0.9999
print(randint(5, 20)) # it returns a random integer number between [5, 20] inclusive
```
