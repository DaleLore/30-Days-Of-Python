# Exercises - Day 1
## Exercise: Level 1
1. Check the python version you are using
2. Open the python interactive shell and do the following operations. The operands are 3 and 4.
3. Write strings on the python interactive shell. 
4. Check the data types of the following data

## Exercise: Level 2
1. Create a folder named day_1 inside 30DaysOfPython folder
2. Create a python file helloworld.py and repeat questions 1, 2, 3 and 4

## Exercise: Level 3
1. Write an example for different Python data types
2. Find an Euclidian distance between (2, 3) and (10, 8)
    - The [Euclidean distance](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercise-40.php) formula is used to find the distance between two points on an Euclidean plane
    - Points p1=[x1,y1]
    - Points p2=[x2,y2]
    - Formula: d = √(x2-x1)² + (y2 - y1)

# Notes
## Basic Python
### Python Syntax
- An indentation is a white space in a text
- Python uses indentation to create blocks of codes

### Comments
- Any text starting with hash(#) in Python is a comment.
- Single Line Comment
- A triple quote can be used for multiline comment if it is not assigned to a variable

### Data Types
- Check data types using type() function
- Number 
    - Integer   (i.e. 10)
    - Float     (i.e. 3.14)
    - Complex   (i.e. 1 + 3j)
- String(i.e. 'Python')
- Boolean       (i.e. True)
- List          (i.e. [1, 2, 3])     
- Dictionary    (i.e. {'language':'Python'})
- Tuple         (i.e. {9.8, 3.14, 2.7})
- Set           (i.e. (9.8, 3.14, 2.7))
